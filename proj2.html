                I wanted to take inspiration from the Roman Catholic Church. How the pope being the head of the religion is on the spot
                 light and is surrounded by divine light. I wondered if he became the celebrity endorsement for a brand, would people 
                 buy extras? Here is an attempt, where the gelato ice cream is adorned with a bedazzled pope’s crown to show how it 
                 is indeed the head of the ice cream industry not only that - it is pope recommended. In the divine light, 
                 among the dark shadows, the ice cream melts in dramatic action to only show that, “have the gelato and 
                 find the divine in you!”</p>

            <p class="fs-5">The true essence of romanticism.
                Suramya is exactly how you feel when you take a sip of this wine as you drink it. One sip closer to nature!
                I wanted to capture the sheer magic of mother nature. The way she those vines drop to give us, flavourful and
                 juicy grapes which are then crushed by the most natural way using two bare hands to reveal the juiced fruits.
                 Suramya is exactly how you feel when you take a sip of this wine as you drink it. One sip closer to nature!
                 After I chose romanticism as my art movement, I decided to start with looking at the picture, the paintings, 
                 to go over the poetry of Wordsworth and feel it once again.
                 I moved on to start reading about the romantic art movement. It beinga silent revolt towards the 
                 industrial revolution.
                 Going forward I read about the importance and significance of wine throughout time to find so many 
                 interesting facts about its bottling and drinking habits.
                 I started with initial sketches that resulted in a lot of digital painting and mockups to end it.</p>

            <p class="fs-5">Why Coffee?-A drink that saw it all. Post Impressionism was a movement that was a peak inside the mind of 
                every artist. A window into their thinking. But what might have made the artists not paint the surroundings but 
                just take inspiration? Artists, people, authors started sharing their ideas over a coffee in many parts of France 
                as the cafe culture began. The sharing of ideas, the blending of various classes and groups and women spending 
                time in these places made them flourish in the most beautiful way. And it was all over some good old coffee. 
                Coffee was indeed a drink that paved the way to the most basic thing that made us all human. The spark of the 
                conversation over some coffee made some normal people into greatness. </p>
